#OSG.JS

##Create 3D web apps

OSGJS is a WebGL framework based on OpenSceneGraph concepts. It allows an individual to use an "OpenSceneGraph-like" toolbox to interact with WebGL via JavaScript, and provides facilities for exporting various assets to the osgjs format.  
The API is kept as similar to OpenSceneGraph as possible, providing a familiar environment to veterans of the library and introducing newcomers to a popular and heavily-scrutinzed set of interfaces.
