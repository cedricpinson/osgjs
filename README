OSG.JS WebGL framework
----------------------------
(http://osgjs.org/)

OSGJS is a WebGL framework based on OpenSceneGraph concepts. It allows an individual to use an “OpenSceneGraph-like” toolbox to interact with WebGL via JavaScript, and provides facilities for exporting various assets to the osgjs format. The API is kept as similar to OpenSceneGraph as possible, providing a familiar environment to veterans of the library and introducing newcomers to a popular and heavily-scrutinzed set of interfaces

How to build your own Osgjs
----------------------------


First, clone a copy of the main jQuery git repo by running:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/cedricpinson/osgjs.git
```

Enter the directory and install the Node  (install nodeJS if you don't already have it http://nodejs.org/ ) dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g grunt
cd osgjs && npm install
```


Make sure you have `grunt` installed by testing:

```bash
grunt -version
```



Then, to get a complete, minified (w/ Uglify.js), linted (w/ JSHint) version of osgjs, type the following:

```bash
grunt --force
```


The built version of osgjs will be put in the `build/` subdirectory.

(more grunt command are available, just check them with --help, "grunt watch" is a must. A nicer and more complete workflow of grunt usage here: http://merrickchristensen.com/articles/gruntjs-workflow.html )

OpenSceneGraph osgjs plugin
----------------------------

There is a plugin on my openscengraph branch https://github.com/cedricpinson/osg. This plugin will help you to export data from osg to osgjs. osgconv
See:

* `man sh`
* `man bash`
* `man 3 fnmatch`
* `man 5 gitignore`
